# Internal details

## Minimal configurations

In this section, we describe step by step the minimal Buildroot
configuration
[st_stm32mp157f_dk2_defconfig](/configs/st_stm32mp157f_dk2_defconfig)
which targets the STM32MP157F Discovery Kit 2 platform. The other
Buildroot configurations for the other platforms are very similar.

```
BR2_arm=y
BR2_cortex_a7=y
```

Obviously, this tells Buildroot to build a system for the ARM
architecture, and more precisely for a Cortex-A7 based processor. This
will ensure the cross-compilation toolchain targets the correct CPU
architecture and specific CPU core.

```
BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL=y
BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_BOOTLIN=y
BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_BOOTLIN_ARMV7_EABIHF_GLIBC_STABLE=y
```

We decide to use external toolchain. This choice has been made to
reduce the build time of the overall system, and use a well-known
toolchain provided by Bootlin. We use Bootlin stable toolchain instead of
ARM toolchain because ST components are a bit too old in version to bnuild
the latest version of ARM toolchain.

```
BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR="$(BR2_EXTERNAL_ST_PATH)/board/stmicroelectronics/common/patches/"
```

We need to apply one patch to the Linux kernel, which is located in
`board/stmicroelectronics/common/patches/`. This configuration
option tells Buildroot where to find the patches to apply.

```
BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_CREATION_DYNAMIC_MDEV=y
```

This option enables *mdev* (a minimal re-implementation of *udev*
which is part of BusyBox) which takes care of automatically loading
kernel modules, adjusting `/dev` nodes permissions, and more.

```
BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY="$(BR2_EXTERNAL_ST_PATH)/board/stmicroelectronics/stm32mp1/overlay/"
```

This tells Buildroot to copy the contents of
[board/stmicroelectronics/stm32mp1/overlay](/board/stmicroelectronics/stm32mp1/overlay)
into the root filesystem. The important file that this copies to the
root filesystem is `/boot/extlinux.conf`, which tells the U-Boot
bootloader how to boot the Linux system (which Linux kernel image to
load, which Device Tree to use, which kernel arguments to pass). It
also adds the Wifi firmware and the sound configuration files but
these are only used in the *demo* configurations, not the minimal
ones.

```
BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT="$(BR2_EXTERNAL_ST_PATH)/board/stmicroelectronics/common/post-build.sh"
```

This tells Buildroot to run
[board/stmicroelectronics/common/post-build.sh](/board/stmicroelectronics/common/post-build.sh)
at the end of the rootfs generation. This script update the
extlinux.conf of the overlay to use the correct Device Tree file at
boot.

```
BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT="$(BR2_EXTERNAL_ST_PATH)/board/stmicroelectronics/common/post-image.sh"
```

This tells Buildroot to run
[board/stmicroelectronics/common/post-image.sh](/board/stmicroelectronics/common/post-image.sh)
at the end of the build. This script produces the final `sdcard.img`
file using a tool called `genimage` and deploys the `flash.tsv` file to
flash the board with STM32 Cube Programmer.

```
BR2_ROOTFS_POST_SCRIPT_ARGS="$(BR2_EXTERNAL_ST_PATH)/board/stmicroelectronics/stm32mp1/genimage.cfg"
```

This is an argument passed to the scripts. It is used by `post-image.sh`
to know which genimage config to use.

```
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_TARBALL=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_TARBALL_LOCATION="$(call github,STMicroelectronics,linux)v6.1-stm32mp-r2.tar.gz"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_DEFCONFIG="multi_v7"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CONFIG_FRAGMENT_FILES="$(LINUX_DIR)/arch/arm/configs/fragment-01-multiv7_cleanup.config $(LINUX_DIR)/arch/arm/configs/fragment-02-multiv7_addons.config $(BR2_EXTERNAL_ST_PATH)/board/stmicroelectronics/common/linux-disable-etnaviv.config"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_DTS_SUPPORT=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_INTREE_DTS_NAME="stm32mp157f-dk2"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_INSTALL_TARGET=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_NEEDS_HOST_OPENSSL=y
```

This set of options tells Buildroot to build a Linux kernel, with the
source code fetched using Git from the repository at
[https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/linux](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/linux). The
Git tag `v6.1-stm32mp-r2` will be used as the kernel version. The
kernel will be configured using the configuration file
[multi_v7_defconfig](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/linux/arch/arm/configs/multi_v7_defconfig)
extended with three configuration fragments:

1. [fragment-01-multiv7_cleanup.config](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/linux/arch/arm/configs/fragment-01-multiv7_cleanup.config),
which comes from the ST kernel tree, and that disables a number of
kernel drivers/features that are not needed on STM32MP1

2. [fragment-02-multiv7_addons.config](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/linux/arch/arm/configs/fragment-02-multiv7_addons.config),
which comes from the ST kernel tree, and which enables a few
additional kernel drivers/features taht are relevant on STM32MP1

3. [linux-disable-etnaviv.config](/board/stmicroelectronics/common/linux-disable-etnaviv.config),
which comes from this `BR2_EXTERNAL`, and is in charge of disabling
the Etnaviv GPU kernel driver, as we use the proprietary GPU driver
provided by ST instead.

The option `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_INTREE_DTS_NAME` indicates that the
`stm32mp157f-dk2.dtb` Device Tree file will be produced and should be
used. Finally `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_INSTALL_TARGET=y` tells that the
kernel image should be installed to the target root filesystem, in
`/boot`.

```
BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2=y
BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_4=y
BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE="120M"
# BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_TAR is not set
```

This set of options tell Buildroot to generate an *ext4* filesystem
image for the root filesystem, and to not build the default filesystem
image, which is a tarball (`.tar`).

```
BR2_TARGET_ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE=y
BR2_TARGET_ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE_CUSTOM_TARBALL=y
BR2_TARGET_ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE_CUSTOM_TARBALL_LOCATION="$(call github,STMicroelectronics,arm-trusted-firmware)v2.8-stm32mp-r2.tar.gz"

BR2_TARGET_ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE_ADDITIONAL_VARIABLES="STM32MP_SDMMC=1 AARCH32_SP=optee DTB_FILE_NAME=stm32mp157f-dk2.dtb BL33_CFG=$(BINARIES_DIR)/u-boot.dtb STM32MP1_OPTEE_IN_SYSRAM=1 OPENSSL_DIR=$(BR2_HOST_DIR)"
BR2_TARGET_ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE_IMAGES="*.stm32 fip.bin"
BR2_TARGET_ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE_NEEDS_DTC=y
```

These options tell Buildroot how to build TF-A, the Trusted
Firmware. It is retrieved from the Git repository at
[https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/arm-trusted-firmware](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/arm-trusted-firmware),
using version `v2.8-stm32mp-r2`. TF-A is configured for the `stm32mp1`
platform with OP-TEE as BL32, and we use the mechanism of
[FIP](https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/tools-build.html)
images. The Device Tree file being used in TF-A comes from the TF-A
source code, and is named `stm32mp157f-dk2.dtb`.

```
BR2_PACKAGE_OPTEE_CLIENT=y
BR2_PACKAGE_OPTEE_CLIENT_CUSTOM_TARBALL=y
BR2_PACKAGE_OPTEE_CLIENT_CUSTOM_TARBALL_LOCATION="$(call github,OP-TEE,optee_client)3.19.0.tar.gz"
...

BR2_TARGET_OPTEE_OS_PLATFORM_FLAVOR="157F_DK2"
BR2_TARGET_OPTEE_OS_ADDITIONAL_VARIABLES="CFG_STM32MP1_OPTEE_IN_SYSRAM=y"
```

These options configure the build of OP-TEE as a trusted execution
environment, as well as the user-space OP-TEE client programs.
It is fetched from the Git repository
[https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/optee_os](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/optee_os),
in version `3.19.0-stm32mp-r2`. The platform is `stm32mp1` and its flavor
is `157F_DK2`

```
BR2_TARGET_UBOOT=y
BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_BUILD_SYSTEM_KCONFIG=y
BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_CUSTOM_TARBALL=y

BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_FORMAT_CUSTOM_NAME="u-boot-nodtb.bin u-boot.dtb"
BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_CUSTOM_MAKEOPTS="DEVICE_TREE=stm32mp157f-dk2"
```

These options tell Buildroot how to build U-Boot: it is fetched from
the Git repository at
[https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/u-boot](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/u-boot),
in version `v2022.10-stm32mp-r2`. The configuration used is
`stm32mp15`, and we install both the `u-boot-nodtb.bin` and
`u-boot.dtb` images as both are used for the TF-A build. The Device
Tree file used comes from the U-Boot source code, and is named
`stm32mp157f-dk2`.

```
BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_BMAP_TOOLS=y
```

This option tells Buildroot to build the `bmap` utility for the host. This
is used to produce block map files alongside the image.

```
BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GENIMAGE=y
```

This last option tells Buildroot to build the `genimage` utility for
the host, as it is used to produce the SD card image.

What is not visible in this configuration are all the defaults that
Buildroot has: it will by default integrate Busybox in the root
filesystem image, and use a number of sane defaults to build a basic
embedded Linux system.

## Demo configurations

In this section, we describe the demo configuration
[st_stm32mp157f_dk2_demo_defconfig](/configs/st_stm32mp157f_dk2_demo_defconfig)
for the STM32MP157F Discovery Kit 2. Here as well, all other *demo*
configurations for the other platforms are very similar.

```
BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_CREATION_DYNAMIC_EUDEV=y
```

This option enables *eudev* instead of *mdev* selected by the basic
configuration. It manages devices node and handles all user space actions
when adding or removing devices.

BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_DTB_OVERLAY_SUPPORT=y
```

The demo configurations use a Linux kernel Device Tree file produced
by STM32 Cube MX. These two options tell Buildroot where to find these
Device Tree files, and which one to use. The last option enables the
`-@` Device Tree compiler build option, which produces Device Tree
files with slightly more information, making it possible for the
U-Boot bootloader to automatically tweak the Device Tree files passed
to the Linux kernel when booting.

## Changes compared to upstream Buildroot

The `st/2024.02.3` branch of this `BR2_EXTERNAL` is designed to work
with Buildroot 2024.02.3. However, we needed a few changes compared to
upstream Buildroot 2024.02.10, which can be seen at
[https://github.com/bootlin/buildroot/commits/st/2024.02.3](https://github.com/bootlin/buildroot/commits/st/2024.02.3). We
have just 11 changes on top of Buildroot 2024.02.3, and they can easily
be rebased on top of the latest Buildroot 2024.02.x to continue to
benefit from the security fixes provided by the Buildroot community.

Here are the 11 changes:

* Update the `gcnano-binaries` package to a newer version and to support
  arm64. This package contains the closed-source OpenGL user-space
  libraries, which need to be in sync with the kernel side.
  This patch has been submitted to upstream Buildroot.

* Add support for host python-intelhex package in preparation of the
  support for Trusted-Firmware-M. This patch has been submitted to
  upstream Buildroot.

* Add support for host python-click package in preparation of the
  support for Trusted-Firmware-M. This patch has been submitted to
  upstream Buildroot.

* Add support for host python-cbor2 package in preparation of the
  support for Trusted-Firmware-M. This patch has been submitted to
  upstream Buildroot.

* Add support for TrustedFirmware-M which is implementing the Secure
  Processing Environment (SPE) for Armv8-M, Armv8.1-M architectures.
  This patch has been submitted to upstream Buildroot.

* Add support for custom tarball source in optee-client to be able to
  match the OPTEE-OS custom tarball version. This patch has been
  submitted to upstream Buildroot.

* Add support for custom tarball source in optee-test to be able to
  match the OPTEE-OS custom tarball version. This patch has been
  submitted to upstream Buildroot.

* Add support for custom tarball source in optee-examples to be able to
  match the OPTEE-OS custom tarball version. This patch has been
  submitted to upstream Buildroot.

* Add support to build OP-TEE OS with host-cmake as the new version of
  OP-TEE OS from ST need cmake to build its scmi firmware. This patch has been
  submitted to upstream Buildroot.

* Update linux to manage vendor name subfolder directory for
  BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_DTS_PATH. It adds support to build
  devicetree files which are organize under vendor subdirectories like
  for arm and arm64 architectures, such as
  arch/<arch>/boot/dts/<vendor>/. This patch has been submitted to
  upstream Buildroot.

* Bump arm-gnu-toolchain package to 13.2.rel1 release version.
  This patch is already in upstream Buildroot.
